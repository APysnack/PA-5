How to run the program?
------------------------------------------
You should be able to simply run the PA-5-Executable.exe file on any Windows operating system and follow along with the prompts. 

A demo is given here in case there are any issues. This demo uses the data from the MaxEarning.png chart Dr. Huang gave us:

1 - Allows you to enter a series of tasks (Note that this will clear the list of any existing tasks)
2 - Allows you to view the tasks you've entered in text format (optional)
3 - Allows you to delete a single task from your list of tasks (optional)
4 - Will perform the calculations and display the chart of tasks
5 - Exit the program immediately


------------------------------------------
Because of the complexity of this assignment and the short time-frame, there are some noteworthy caveats:
------------------------------------------

1. Please disregard the warning regarding matplotlib. Their newer version removed a file that pyinstaller was dependent upon and a solution could not be found to suppress this warning successfully.
2. For a large quantity of tasks (12+) the scaling on the graph display may be off
3. Windows defender may flag the executable as a threat. No csv files were included for this project since the homework details do not mention including a csv file.
